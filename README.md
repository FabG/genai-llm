# Gen AI LLM

This repo inclueds courses, code snippets from various sources to better learn and build an intuition about Large Language Models
I first enrolled in a course from Deeplearning.ai called [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) Course from AWS and Deeplearning.ai.
The main reason is my prior experience with Deeplearnin.ai as I gained a lot of knowledge from 2 prior courses from Andrew Ng and his team, namely: 
 - [Machine Learning specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
 - [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/)

# Gen AI LLM

![generative-ai-with-llms-1](images/generative-ai-with-llms-1.png)

This repo inclueds courses, code snippets from various sources to better learn and build an intuition about Large Language Models
I first enrolled in a course from Deeplearning.ai called [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms) Course from AWS and Deeplearning.ai.
The main reason is my prior experience with Deeplearnin.ai as I gained a lot of knowledge from 2 prior courses from Andrew Ng and his team, namely [Machine Learning specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/) and [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/)
